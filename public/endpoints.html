no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought
I would buy a laptop about a little and see the codey part of the world. It is a
way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I
find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin
warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially
whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to
coding as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a
philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the
laptop. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
towards the the Vaio with me.", "created_at": "1982-11-24T12:21:54.171Z",
